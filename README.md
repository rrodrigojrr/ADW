Angular Distance Weighting and Inverse Distance Weighting methods for interpolation of irregular network of meteorological observations to a regular grid.

Inverse distance weighting (IDW) is a type of deterministic method for multivariate interpolation with a known scattered set of points. The assigned values to unknown points are calculated with a weighted that variate in function of distance. The method did propose by Sherpard's (1968).

The Angular Distance Weighting (ADW) is a modifield version of Sherpard's algorithm (Hofstra & New, 2009). The weights are estimed in function of the distance and angle between the stations.
